# GearHead 


GearHead is a way to add, edit, update, and delete all of your gear purchases through its lifespans. Users will start by creating their account with their basic information and selecting their instrument. Then users can view a list of all of their currently owned pieces of gear, add a new piece of gear, add unowned gear to their wishlist, mark and filter which pieces of gear are due for an upgrade, and even view a list of gear that they want in the wishlist view.
